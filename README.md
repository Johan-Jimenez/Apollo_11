# Apolo-11: NASA Monitoring System

This project, named "Apolo-11," aims to simulate and consolidate records generated by various components, such as satellites, spacecraft, suits, and spacecraft, in the context of NASA's current ambitious projects.

## Project Description

NASA is seeking to implement a unified monitoring system based on file transmission, operating at 20-second intervals. This system will allow detailed control over the operational state of each component, facilitating decision-making and preventive actions.

## Execution Instructions

### Program Location

The "Apolo-11" program should be placed in the user's preferred folder.

### Program Execution

Navigate to the program's location and execute it. After synchronization, the collected information will be stored in the {preferred_path}/devices directory.

### Execution Periodicity

Execution occurs every 20 seconds (adjustable).

### File Naming

Generated files follow the format: APL[ORBONE|CLNM|TMRS|GALXONE|UNKN]-0000[1-1000].log.

### File Generation

Random quantity of files (1-100) per execution. Semi-structured data: date, mission, device type, device status, and hash.

### Naming and Hash Generation

Mission names match the original project names. Hash is generated if the filename even if the device status is not "unknown."

### Report Generation

Files named APLSTATS-[REPORT]-ddmmyyHHMISS.log. Analysis of events, disconnection management, mission consolidation, percentage calculation. File cleanup, moved to the "backups" folder.

### Control Board

File simulating a control board for data visualization.

## Special Considerations

- Project adaptable to different servers.
- Flexible design for changes in data generation and management.
- Seamless integration with future teams, tools, or processes.
- Valuation of additional ideas and implementations.

## Technologies Used

- YAML for configurations.
- LOGGING for event logging.
- TYPING for type annotations.
- ENTRYPOINT and MAIN for program execution.
- SYS ARGS and PARSEARGS for handling command-line arguments.

## Simulated Data

Simulated data mimics the behavior of real data, providing a safe way to test algorithms without associated risks.

## File Structuring

Each file is associated with an execution cycle, ensuring precise control and optimal data management.

## Usage 

"python apollo11.py --config config/config.yml --project [ORBONE|CLNM|TMRS|GALXONE|UNKN]"

"Make sure to provide the --config argument with the path to the YAML configuration file."
